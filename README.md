# SimpleMultilayerPerceptron
Simple multilayer perceptron recognizes numbers from MNIST.

The idea and theory are taken from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBYQWvz13Ds) from the channel HardMath.
The code has been studied and has not changed for the most part, except for its own Matrix and Vector classes.

Training and test data are archived. The neural network works with data in the range from 0 to 1.

### Examples of training and testing

...and with other params
